  'The Rogue Elephant Company was started out of a belief that the home improvement and home repair industries should have access to all the convenience and technological advancements that every other industry uses. The home improvement industry is a highly fragmented $400B industry, and we believe there is a great opportunity to create a single brand you can count on for all your home repairs.',
  "When your furnace goes out, or your refrigerator needs to be repaired, it can be difficult to find a reputable repairman, schedule an appointemnt, and then miss a day of work while waiting for the technician to come between the hours of 10 and 4. Once the technician comes to your house, it takes 30 minutes to assess the problem, give you an estimate, and then inform you that he doesn't have the required part in his truck, meaning he will have to come back later in the week, causing you to miss another day of work. We think this process is broken and set out to create a new process this is easy, transparent, and convenient for you, the customer.",
